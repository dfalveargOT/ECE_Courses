# ECE_Courses

This repository contains the developed material of machine learning and robotics courses in the Master of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Feel free to explore the work and projects I developed during my study journey.

**Deep Learning for Visual Computing (Grade A)**

The course provided a comprehensive overview of deep learning applications in visual computing. The methodology involved studying key papers in the field and implementing concepts using PyTorch. Through this approach, the course introduced optimization, neural network architectures, and training practices, which were then applied to solve tasks such as object detection, segmentation, image generation, and more. The course is structured into five projects, each covering important aspects of deep learning applications in visual computing.

**Numerical Optimization (Grade A)**

This course presents practical methods for formulating and solving linear and nonlinear numerical optimization problems that arise in science, engineering, and business applications. The course covers both unconstrained and constrained problems, with an emphasis on algorithmic descriptions. A significant component of the course involves implementing solutions, where students develop code and use state-of-the-art numerical libraries to model and solve problems in machine learning, imaging, shape design, parameter identification, classification, financial planning, PDE-constrained optimization, and other areas.

**Linear Control theory (Grade A)**

The course was focused on learning methods for modeling physical and robotics systems to provide a state-space representation and analyze the dynamics of the systems if it is linear or nonlinear. For nonlinear and time-varying systems the course provided the techniques to find a linear system representation within certain conditions. After finding a linear system the course explored the necessary concepts to be able to compute a feedback control desing for state feedback stabilization and observer desing. The course provided LQR and H_inf methods for find solutions to the state feedback with applications of state reference and trajectory reference tracking. Summarizing, the course focused on learning methods for modeling, analysis, and feedback desing for linear systems.

**Robot Planning and Control (Grade A)**

This course covered the essential principles of autonomous robotics. It covered key topics such as modeling the dynamics of robotic systems, designing feedback control systems, and planning and computing trajectories for robots to perform tasks. The course also explored advanced concepts and implementations like Model Predictive Control (MPC) for robotic systems, numerical optimization for trajectory generation using B-splines, and the principles of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). The course project involved developing an LQR controller, a PRM trajectory generator, and a Task Allocator to automate a pick and place operation on an industrial conveyor belt. This project used the PyBullet physics simulator and OMPL library for path planning. The course also included different robotics systems with dynamics and kinematics modeling, such as aerial drones, manipulators, and ground robots.

**Math Foundations of Machine Learning (Grade A)**

A course designed to understand the mathematical foundations of machine learning and the hands-on application in diverse real-world scenarios. It was structured to understand the mathematical tools of machine learning algorithms, how to apply ML tools in real-world data science problems, and how to translate machine learning problems into a mathematical framework. The course covered statistical foundations, clustering, regression, classification, and different types of neural networks with images and natural language processing examples. The course project improved a motion planner that uses graph neural networks to determine trajectories in a robotics context.
